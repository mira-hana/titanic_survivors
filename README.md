## Titanic Dataset Analysis ##

This README.md file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution guidelines for the Titanic dataset analysis project.

## Project Overview ##

This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics and survival outcomes. The analysis explores factors that may have influenced survival rates, such as passenger class, age, sex, and embarkation port.

## Installation Instructions ##

To load these codes:

1. Download the zip file and unzip it.
2. Open RStudio and load the file inside the project
3. Open titanic.R to look at basic codes
4. Open titanic_unit-test.R to calculate_fare_per_person 
5. Open titanic_integration-test.R for Titanic data analysis pipeline
6. Open sample_titanic_dataset.R to see examples of the dataset
7. Open titanic_common_stats.R to view common statistics from this dataset

## Required R packages ##

install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr"))

## Usage Guidelines ##

- THIS Titanic_Survivor project contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis, and generating visualizations.
